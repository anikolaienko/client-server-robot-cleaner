# Robot Cleaner algorithm
Imagine you have a building with multiple floors (levels).
|         |
| ------- |
\| [level 3](/server/src/data/levels/3.txt) \|
\| [level 2](/server/src/data/levels/2.txt) \|
\| [level 1](/server/src/data/levels/1.txt) \|
\| [level 0](/server/src/data/levels/0.txt) \|

Each level has a different floor layout (click on the level links above). Layout symbols meaning:
* "-" empty space where Robot can move.
* "x" obstacle, Robot need to go around it.
* "R" initial Robot position.

So the algorithmic task is to move Robot around the level and visit every empty space avoiding obstacles. Here is a link to [Robot Cleaner task on leetcode.ca](https://leetcode.ca/all/489.html).

There are many solutions to the Robot Cleaner problem. Currently there are implemented 3 approaches:
- `level_aware` - robot knows about the layout, there robot is not blind.
- `blind_with_trace` - robot is blind and remembers the path where it came from to backtrace to previous locations.
- `blind_with_layout` - robot blind and builds a layout in its memory while navigating around. This allows to make better decisions than backtracing.

# System design
We have 3 robots available:
* [Rusty](/robot/start_rusty.sh)
* [Sassy](/robot/start_sassy.sh)
* [Gizmo](/robot/start_gizmo.sh)

Robots are very similar between each other. It's possible to implement different configurations for robots. For now they are only different in `level_aware` algorithm in which direction robot goes first. E.g. **Rusty** likes going NORTH first, when **Sassy** choses to go WEST. Configs are described in [robot/src/robot/data/robot_configs/](robot/src/robot/data/robot_configs/) files.

Two servers **server_1** and **server_2** are connected to Docker hosted Kafka service. This is where **server_1** and **server_2** get commands to send to robots.

To post commands to Kafka topic you need to have a client. For this exercise we just use `kafka-console-producer.sh` available in Kafka Docker image.

# Architecture diagram
![failed to load diagram](/docs/server-client-robot-cleaner.drawio.png)

# Requirements
* Python 3.11 (at least this one was used)
* Docker

# Setup
Let's initialize virtual environments with prerequisites for robot and server:
* Robot
  * In terminal, navigate to [robot](/robot/) folder.
  * Create virtualenv: `virtualenv -p python3.11 .venv`
  * Install dependencies: `.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Server
  * In terminal, navigate to [server](/server/) folder.
  * Create virtualenv: `virtualenv -p python3.11 .venv`
  * Install dependencies: `.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt`

# Run in standalone mode
Robots can be run in `standalone` mode. Convenient for algorithm testing.

To launch robot in standalone mode run the following command from `robot` folder:
```bash
. start_rusty.sh -S -l 1 -s 5 -a level_aware
```

In `standalone` mode user needs to specify:
* `-S` - standalone mode.
* `-l 0` - index of level to clean. Available values: 0, 1, 2, 3.
* `-s 5` - robot speed. Available values: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
* `-a level_aware` - cleaning algorithm. Available values: blind_with_trace, blind_with_layout, level_aware

# Run in client/server mode
To launch the whole system we need several terminal windows, at least 3: robot, server, kafka client.

Launch system:
* Launch kafka broker:
  * In terminal, navigate to [kafka_queue](/kafka_queue/) folder.
  * Run: `docker compose up -d`
* Launch kafka client:
  * In same terminal, you can run client:
    ```bash 
    docker run -it --rm \
      --network kafka_queue_app-tier \
      bitnami/kafka:3.7.0 /bin/bash
    ```
* Launch server:
  * In new terminal window, navigate to [server](/server/) folder.
  * Run: `. start_server_1.sh`
* Run robot:
  * In new terminal window, navigate to [robot](/robot/) folder.
  * Run: `. start_rusty.sh -p 8080`

Now in kafka client we need to create topics:
```bash
kafka-topics.sh --create --topic commands --bootstrap-server kafka-server:9092
```

Finally, we can publish commands. In kafka client launch producer:
```bash
kafka-console-producer.sh --topic commands --bootstrap-server kafka-server:9092
```

After you launched Kafka producer you can type messages and send them pressing Enter. If you with to finish session, press Cmd+C.

Valid producer commands:
```bash
# get and display robot firmware version in server 
version

# run cleaning for robot ? on level ?
clean robot Rusty level 0

# optionally you can set algorithm and speed (algo ? speed ?)
# speed values: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (fastest)
# algo values: blind_with_trace (default), blind_with_layout, level_aware
clean robot Rusty level 0 algo level_aware speed 5

# pause robot
pause robot Rusty

# resume robot
resume robot Rusty

# reset robot, stop cleaning task completely
reset robot Rusty

# speed, int values 1 to 5, where 5 is the fastest
speed value 3 robot Rusty
```

In commands, character case (lower/upper) matters. Command format is required but key value pairs order doesn't matter:
```bash
[command] [key] [value] ...
# e.g.
clean robot Rusty level 0
# same as
clean level 0 robot Rusty
```
